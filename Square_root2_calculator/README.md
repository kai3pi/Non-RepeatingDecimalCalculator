# Square root of 2 Calculator
This repository contains a Python script, `cal_napier_number.py`, which calculates Square root of 2 to a specified number of digits using the Newton's method.



## Installation

Cloning this repository will create a `Non-RepeatingDecimalCalculator` folder in the current directory where you run the command.
For example, if you clone in your home directory, the folder will be created in `/Users/your_user_name/Non-RepeatingDecimalCalculator`.

If you want to change the save location of the folder, use the cd command to move to your desired directory before executing the clone command.


To get started with this project, you'll need to clone the repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

``` copy
git clone https://github.com/kai3pi/Non-RepeatingDecimalCalculator.git
```



## Usage
__To run this script, you must have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.__

__Process__


First, use the cd command to go to the clone directory. The clone directory contains `Square_root2_calculator`, `Square_root5_calculator`, etc. 
Move to the folder of the calculator you want to use.

```copy
cd /Square_root2_calculator
````
This command gives you access to a file that allows you to calculate the Square root of 2.


Next, execute the following command in the command line:

``` copy
python3 cal_square_root2.py [digits]
```

Replace [digits] with the number of digits you want napier's number calculated to.
If you want to calculate 10 digits, the code will look like this:

``` copy
python3 cal_square_root2.py 10
```
